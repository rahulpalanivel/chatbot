      "**Core Concept:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 6 outlines the conditions under which a member can continue their Member Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Dependent Life Insurance coverage while disabled. This allows coverage to continue even when the member is unable to work due to a disability.\n",

      "**Key Requirements for Coverage During Disability (Section a):**\n",
      "\n",
      "To qualify for continued coverage during disability, a member must meet ALL of the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Become Disabled While Insured:** The member must become ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Disabled or Totally Disabled while they are already insured under the Member Life Insurance policy.\n",
      "2.  **Disability Before Age 60:** The disability (ADL or Total) must begin before the member reaches the age of 60.\n",
      "3.  **Continuous Disability:** The member must remain continuously ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled. There can't be a break in the disability.\n",
      "4.  **Physician Care:** The member must be under the regular care and attendance of a physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "**When Coverage Ceases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if the member initially qualifies, the Coverage During Disability will end on the earliest of the following dates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **End of Disability:** The date the member's Total Disability ends.\n",
      "2.  **Failure to Provide Proof:** The date the member fails to provide The Principal (the insurance company) with required proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability.\n",
      "3.  **Lapse in Physician Care:** The date the member stops being under the regular care and attendance of a physician.\n",
      "4.  **Failure to Submit to Medical Examination:** The date the member fails to submit to a required Medical Examination or Evaluation.\n",
      "5.  **Attaining Age 70:** The date the member reaches age 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations**\n",
